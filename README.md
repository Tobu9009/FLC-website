Roadmap
Base project: The website. No deadline, but work whenever you have time. Consider modularity for upcoming events. Every change should be made in a pull request and reviewed by at least of 2 of us before a push. Every image should be included in the images folder.    

To-do: 
* Implement Nav Bar
* Bodies
* Footer
 The logo will be the original Father's Love Church logo. Have it appear on every page.

* Set color/themes
The color of the website will probably follow a beige color as well as white.
Colors Used: 

#991732
#DB6B5A
#F2DBD0
#DEB48A
#F2E7D0
