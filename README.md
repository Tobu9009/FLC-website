Roadmap
Base project: The website. Should be finished in a month. Consider modularity for upcoming events. Every change should be made in a pull request and reviewed by at least of 2 of us before a push. Every image should be included in the images folder.    

Implement logos 
The logo will be the original Father's Love Church logo. Have it appear on every page.

Set color/themes
The color of the website will probably follow a beige color as well as white.
Colors Used:
